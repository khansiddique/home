### Governance, Risk, Compliance (GRC) - Cyber Resilience Initiative
[Publication](https://medium.com/@weexplore2learn/enhancing-cybersecurity-maturity-a-comprehensive-grc-analysis-and-nist-csf-implementation-at-9037658a69ef)

Commencing a major project at GoodCorp (a dummy organization), I led the Cyber Resilience Initiative, using it as a model for [compliance audit data](https://github.com/khansiddique/GRC-LAB-1_Cyber-Risk-and-Maturity-Assessments/blob/main/Compliance_Fundamentals--Lab-1_Cyber_Risk_%26_Maturity_Assessments.pdf). We seamlessly integrated a Comprehensive Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) Analysis with the strategic implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). Leveraging the [NIST CSF Maturity Tool v2.1](https://github.com/khansiddique/GRC-LAB-1_Cyber-Risk-and-Maturity-Assessments/blob/main/NIST-CSF-Maturity-Tool-v2.1%20-%20Copy_and_Edited.xlsx), we conducted a meticulous Cyber Risk & Maturity Assessment, providing strategic insights to bolster defenses and mitigate risks. The GRC framework, aligned with NIST-800-53, BS7799, ISO27001, Cobit 5, and ISA 62443 standards, ensured optimal resource utilization and effectiveness. The implementation of ISO 27001 principles and a comprehensive ISMS, coupled with continuous improvement through internal audits, fostered a cybersecurity-aware culture at GoodCorp. The Cyber Resilience Initiative, anchored by the use of the Compliance Audit Data file, not only fortified cybersecurity defenses but also positioned GoodCorp as a proactive player in the ever-evolving landscape.

### Comprehensive Security Framework for Hospital Information Systems
[Publication](https://medium.com/@weexplore2learn/fortifying-healthcare-a-comprehensive-security-framework-for-hospital-information-systems-32a99cd97ec8)

In this comprehensive research project, I spearheaded the development of a robust security framework for Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and Hospital Management Systems (HMS) to counter evolving threats in healthcare. By integrating advanced technologies like 5G communication and medical device simulations, the framework ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive medical data. The project covers diverse aspects, including threat modeling using the STRIDE framework, simulation of medical devices via Docker containers and the DICOM protocol, web application development with Flask, and advanced custom networking in Docker. Additionally, I implemented preventive measures such as network segmentation, encryption, and continuous monitoring, alongside remediation strategies like container isolation and timely updates. The paper concludes by emphasizing the significance of a comprehensive security approach in the dynamic landscape of healthcare technology, providing recommendations for enhancing data security and resilience in 5G-enabled medical networks.
